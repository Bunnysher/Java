# Shopping and Ordering System Program in Java


**Objective**:  
This program simulates the ordering and purchasing system of a computer store by implementing a GUI.


**Structure of the code**:  
The program includes classes that correspond to products selling in a computer shop. Product class which corresponds to the availble products in the store was initially constructed. Computer store products are divided into two categories: a) Computer compartments and b) Peripherals. Therefore, two subclasses of the Product class are created: a) the HardWare class and b) the Peripherals class. Those classes are also divided into distinct products under each category. The lists of sales, orders and products are read via strictured files given the flexibility of adding or removing entries.
