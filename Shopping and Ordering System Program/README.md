# Shopping and Ordering System Program in Java


**Objective**:  
This program simulates the ordering and purchasing system of a computer store by implementing a GUI.


**Structure of the code**:  
The program includes multiple classes that correspond to products selling in a computer shop. More specifically, we initially construct the Product class which corresponds to the availble products in the store. Computer store products are divided into two categories: a) Computer compartments and b) Peripherals. Based on the fact that price discounts are common within each category, we create two subclasses of the Product class: a) the HardWare class and b) the Peripherals class. Those classes are also divided into distinct products under each category.
